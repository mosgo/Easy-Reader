# 📖 **Easy Reader** 📖



Easy Reader is a news app which fetches local UK news from official XML sources, utilising wxWidgets and pugixml. The application is very simple, all you need to do is select your news source and click 'Refresh' if you want to update the output with the most recent news articles.

This doesn't come with all of the necessary DLL's, so you will need to install those into the folder yourself.
